# Technical Role Prompts Collection

A comprehensive collection of AI role prompts designed to make complex technical roles more approachable and practical. This collection focuses on essential development roles while providing a clear path from beginner to advanced usage.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Essential Development Roles

The Technical Role Prompts Collection is designed to make AI assistance in software development more accessible and effective. We focus on core development roles that provide the foundation for successful software projects.

### The Core Development Team

#### Software Engineer
Your coding companion for daily development tasks
- [View Role](prompts/core/software-engineer.md)
- Focuses on implementation and coding
- Handles feature development, bug fixing, and optimization
- Works closely with Technical Architect for guidance
- [See Examples](docs/examples/basic/engineer-architect-workflow.md#feature-implementation-workflow)

#### Technical Architect
Your design partner for technical decisions
- [View Role](prompts/core/technical-architect.md)
- Focuses on system design and guidance
- Makes architectural decisions
- Sets technical standards
- [See Examples](docs/examples/basic/engineer-architect-workflow.md#problem-solving-workflow)

### Working Together

The Engineer and Architect roles are designed to complement each other:
- Engineer implements while Architect guides
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Efficient collaboration patterns
- Proven workflow examples

[See detailed workflow examples](docs/examples/basic/engineer-architect-workflow.md)
