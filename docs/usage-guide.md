# Usage Guide

This guide helps you get started with the Technical Role Prompts Collection and shows you how to effectively use the different roles in your development workflow.

## Getting Started

### 1. Understanding the Core Development Duo

The collection is centered around two primary roles:

#### Software Engineer
- Your implementation partner
- Handles coding tasks
- Focuses on practical implementation
- Works with concrete solutions

#### Technical Architect
- Your design guide
- Makes architectural decisions
- Focuses on system design
- Works with abstract concepts

### 2. Basic Workflow

1. **Start with the Right Role**
   - Use Engineer for implementation tasks
   - Use Architect for design decisions
   - Combine both for complex features

2. **Be Specific**
   - Provide clear requirements
   - Include relevant context
   - Specify constraints
   - Mention related systems

3. **Iterate as Needed**
   - Start with high-level design (Architect)
   - Move to implementation (Engineer)
   - Review and refine (Both)

## Common Use Cases

### 1. New Feature Development

```
# Step 1: Architecture Design
User -> Architect: "Design a user authentication system"
Architect: Provides system design and requirements

# Step 2: Implementation
User -> Engineer: "Implement the authentication system"
Engineer: Creates the implementation

# Step 3: Review
User -> Architect: "Review the implementation"
Architect: Reviews and suggests improvements
```

### 2. Problem Solving

```
# Step 1: Problem Analysis
User -> Engineer: "Investigate slow page load"
Engineer: Identifies technical issues

# Step 2: Solution Design
User -> Architect: "Design solution for performance"
Architect: Provides optimization strategy

# Step 3: Implementation
User -> Engineer: "Implement performance fixes"
Engineer: Applies optimizations
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Role Selection

- Use Engineer for:
  * Writing code
  * Debugging issues
  * Implementing features
  * Writing tests
  * Performance optimization

- Use Architect for:
  * System design
  * Technology choices
  * Standards setting
  * Architecture review
  * Scaling strategies

### 2. Communication Tips

- Be clear and specific
- Provide context
- State constraints
- Mention dependencies
- Include requirements

### 3. Workflow Tips

- Start with design
- Break down complex tasks
- Review regularly
- Document decisions
- Test thoroughly

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Combining Roles

```
User: "We need to add a payment system"

# Architecture Phase
Architect: Design payment flow and integration

# Implementation Phase
Engineer: Implement payment processing

# Review Phase
Architect: Review security measures
Engineer: Implement improvements
```

### 2. Using Supporting Roles

- Add Technical Writer for documentation
- Include DevOps Engineer for deployment
- Engage Support Engineer for maintenance

### 3. Specialized Scenarios

- Cloud Architecture
- Security Implementation
- Data Processing
- Mobile Development
- UI/UX Design

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Unclear Requirements**
   - Break down the problem
   - Ask specific questions
   - Get concrete examples

2. **Complex Problems**
   - Start with architecture
   - Break into smaller tasks
   - Review incrementally

3. **Integration Challenges**
   - Review system design
   - Check dependencies
   - Test thoroughly

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with simple tasks
   - Learn role capabilities
   - Build complexity gradually

2. **Document Everything**
   - Keep design docs
   - Record decisions
   - Maintain examples

3. **Regular Reviews**
   - Check progress
   - Validate solutions
   - Refine approach

## Next Steps

1. Review example workflows
2. Try simple tasks
3. Explore specialized roles
4. Build complex solutions
5. Share your experiences
