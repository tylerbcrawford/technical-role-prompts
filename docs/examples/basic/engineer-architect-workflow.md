# Engineer + Architect Workflow Examples

This guide demonstrates how the Software Engineer and Technical Architect roles work together effectively through common development scenarios.

## Feature Implementation Workflow

### Scenario: Implementing a New User Authentication System

1. **Initial Discussion**
   ```
   User: "We need to implement user authentication for our application"
   Architect: "Let me outline the authentication strategy:
   - Use JWT for stateless authentication
   - Implement refresh token rotation
   - Store hashed passwords using bcrypt
   - Add rate limiting for security
   - Include 2FA support"
   ```

2. **Design Review**
   ```
   Engineer: "I'll implement the authentication system. For the JWT implementation, I'm considering:
   - Using the jsonwebtoken library
   - 15-minute access token expiry
   - 7-day refresh token with rotation
   - Redis for token blacklisting"
   
   Architect: "Good approach. Some adjustments:
   - Add rate limiting middleware
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add audit logging"
   ```

3. **Implementation**
   ```
   Engineer: "I've implemented the core authentication:
   - JWT middleware is working
   - Password hashing implemented
   - Basic routes are set up
   Would you review the implementation?"

   Architect: "Looking at the implementation:
   - Add refresh token rotation
   - Strengthen password requirements
   - Implement proper logout
   - Add more comprehensive error handling"
   ```

4. **Refinement**
   ```
   Engineer: "I've added the suggested improvements:
   - Refresh token rotation implemented
   - Added password validation
   - Improved error messages
   - Added proper logout endpoint"

   Architect: "Looks good. Final recommendations:
   - Add API documentation
   - Include usage examples
   - Add security headers
   - Set up monitoring"
   ```

## Problem-Solving Workflow

### Scenario: Addressing Performance Issues

1. **Problem Identification**
   ```
   Engineer: "We're seeing slow response times in the user dashboard"
   
   Architect: "Let's analyze the system:
   - Check database query performance
   - Review caching strategy
   - Analyze API response times
   - Monitor resource usage"
   ```

2. **Solution Design**
   ```
   Architect: "Based on analysis:
   - Implement Redis caching
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add pagination
   - Consider data denormalization"

   Engineer: "I can implement these changes:
   - Add Redis for session data
   - Rewrite problematic queries
   - Implement infinite scroll
   - Add performance monitoring"
   ```

3. **Implementation and Validation**
   ```
   Engineer: "Changes implemented:
   - Added caching layer
   - Optimized main queries
   - Added monitoring
   What should we measure?"

   Architect: "Let's validate:
   - Response time improvements
   - Cache hit rates
   - Server resource usage
   - User experience metrics"
   ```

## Best Practices for Collaboration

1. **Clear Communication**
   - Architect provides clear, actionable guidance
   - Engineer asks questions when requirements are unclear
   - Both roles document decisions and rationale

2. **Regular Reviews**
   - Early design reviews prevent issues
   - Regular implementation checks
   - Performance and security reviews
   - Code quality maintenance

3. **Shared Responsibility**
   - Both roles consider security
   - Both contribute to documentation
   - Both focus on code quality
   - Both participate in problem-solving

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regular feedback between roles
   - Shared learning from challenges
   - Documentation of lessons learned
   - Process refinement

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Communication Gaps**
   - Unclear requirements
   - Unstated assumptions
   - Delayed feedback
   - Missing documentation

2. **Technical Debt**
   - Rushed implementations
   - Skipped reviews
   - Incomplete documentation
   - Postponed improvements

3. **Role Confusion**
   - Unclear responsibilities
   - Overlapping decisions
   - Missing accountability
   - Incomplete handoffs

## Success Metrics

- Clean, maintainable code
- Well-documented systems
- Efficient problem resolution
- Smooth collaboration
- Consistent improvement
- High-quality deliverables
